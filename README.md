# GradMath
This is a mathematical library written by Haoyuan Luo based on Mathlib. Mathlib is great. However, because many theorems in mathlib are given in the most general settings, they are also quite abstract, creating barriers for beginners and people in other disciplines. 
The theorems in GradMath are given in a more friendly way, most of which agree exactly with those on textbooks. Although it is far from finished, the author hope that anyone can find it easy to use and be able to rigorously verify their results with LEAN.
